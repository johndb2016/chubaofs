github.com/chubaoio/cbfs/fuse -- Filesystems in Go
===================================

`github.com/chubaoio/cbfs/fuse` is a Go library for writing FUSE userspace
filesystems.

It is a from-scratch implementation of the kernel-userspace
communication protocol, and does not use the C library from the
project called FUSE. `github.com/chubaoio/cbfs/fuse` embraces Go fully for safety and
ease of programming.

Hereâ€™s how to get going:

based on.
